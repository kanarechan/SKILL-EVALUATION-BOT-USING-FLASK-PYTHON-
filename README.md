# SKILL-EVALUATION-BOT
This skill evaluation bot is made to solve the hiring or recruitment problem. In this project, we will filter the students on the basis of their backlog, attendance, CGPA, skill, and experience. I have also used agora.io SDK in order to provide a video chat platform for the users or the HR in order to take the personal interview or conducting an group discussion.

I have used HTML and CSS to design or make the index page of my project. pandas from python is also used in order to use file handling. python framework FLASK is used for making a simple backend for this project.
